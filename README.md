## Exploratory Data Analysis of 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Data

### Project Description

This project was produced in 2019 for the course **"Introduction to Probability and Data"**, the first in the five course sequence for the Coursera Specialization **Statistics with R** produced by Duke University.

2013 data was provided from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).  The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population.  The project tasks were to:

- develop three research questions
- address each research question with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) consisting of a narrative supported by plots and summary statistics

The three research questions chosen were the following:

- Are unemployed females aged 18-64 more likely to have health care coverage than unemployed males?
- What is the difference between the mean number of days physical health was not good over the past 30 days as reported by those who said they were in excellent general health versus those who said they were in poor general health? 
- What are the top three auxiliary forms of exercise reported by female dancers? By male dancers? How do the lists compare?

Coding and documentation were done using `R` and an `R` Markdown file to produce the [project report](https://brianallan.github.io/EDA-Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Data/).
